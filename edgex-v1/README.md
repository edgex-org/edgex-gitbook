# edgeX V1

edgeX V1, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of edgeX, is a high-performance, orderbook-based perpetual decentralized exchange (Perp DEX), crafted to deliver a native trading experience. This is achieved through advanced trading infrastructure, superior performance, and trader-centric features.



**Commitment to Trader Experience**

Recognizing that traders are the foundation of any exchange’s sustainable growth, edgeX is designed to foster organic and long-term engagement. With deep roots in the crypto derivatives space, edgeX team has a profound understanding of trader demands, building edgeX around these needs from the outset. The guiding principle has always been to “build something traders love to use.” The MVP underscores edgeX’s standard of excellence across several key areas:



**Battle-Tested Solution:** Powered by the StarkEx Layer 2 engine, edgeX V1 is built with an on-chain infrastructure that has handled over $1.28 trillion in cumulative trading volume since 2020. This robust solution meets the high demands of professional traders for performance and experience, while ensuring transparency of data and security of assets.



**Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollup:** Each trade on edgeX is validated by third-party committees and batched into Ethereum for transparency. The publication of zero-knowledge proofs on the Ethereum Layer 1 blockchain validates Layer 2 transactions, ensuring their integrity and security.



**Self-Custody:** edgeX ensures traders retain full custody and control of their funds, a key differentiation from centralized exchanges (CEX). The failures of exchanges like FTX have underscored the risks of centralized custody. At edgeX, users maintain self-custody of their assets, allowing for withdrawals at any time without platform permission, thus providing a trustless and secure trading environment.



**Price Integrity and Fairness:** edgeX employs independent oracle providers to obtain mark prices, preventing price manipulation and ensuring an equitable and accurate reflection of asset values. This mechanism safeguards user positions from price manipulation and liquidation issues often seen in centralized exchanges.



**Trading Performance:** The high-performance trading engine of edgeX V1 ensures a seamless and lightning-fast trading experience. Compared to other Performant Perp DEXs, edgeX achieves impressive performance metrics. When scaled up to 10 shards, edgeX outperforms competitors in terms of performance and match latency, delivering a faster and more efficient trading process. These advantages underscore edgeX commitment to providing a top-tier trading experience for professional perpetual traders.



**Professional UX and UI:** edgeX features a professional UI and UX tailored for professional perpetual traders, ensuring a seamless and intuitive trading experience.



**Advanced Trading Features：**&#x65;dgeX offers advanced trading features traditionally available only on CEXs, such as a sub-account system. This allows traders to manage bi-directional positions, optimizing strategies and managing risks more effectively through hedge positions.



**Easiest Onboarding — Social Logins:** With features like MPC wallets, edgeX V1 offers the easiest onboarding process for new users. Traders can register with just an email, and enjoy cross-chain deposit and withdrawal, making the platform accessible to everyone.



**Mobile Version Coming Soon:** Recognizing the importance of retail perpetual traders, the mobile version of edgeX will be launched shortly after the web version, ensuring traders can manage their trades conveniently from any device.
