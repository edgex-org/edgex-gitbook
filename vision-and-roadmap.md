# Vision & Roadmap

"Build something traders love to use." We aim to develop, step by step, from trader-centric applications to a comprehensive trader ecosystem with aggregated liquidity.

This ecosystem will evolve into a "trading collage" made of permissionless financial modules, enabling developers and traders with minimal programming experience to create their own highly customizable and composable trader-centric applications tailored for diverse trading preferences.
