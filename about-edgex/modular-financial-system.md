# Modular Financial system

Blockchain technology has revolutionized traditional production relationships by integrating products, users, and economic models. edgeX’s innovative modular financial system mimics the simplicity of assembling Lego components, meeting diverse user requirements. The modules in edgeX are designed with a remarkably low entry barrier, ensuring both high performance and scalability for all users.

Initially applied to public blockchains, modular system design divides blockchain processing logic into four key sections: consensus, execution, settlement, and data availability. Each section benefits from modular design, enhancing processing efficiency. However, current market modular systems often remain fragmented, imposing high entry barriers that limit scalability. Despite reduced development costs, achieving zero-threshold usage remains challenging for the average user.

edgeX’s modular system overcomes these challenges by focusing on the functionality of financial products, incorporating modules for trading, liquidity, lending, insurance, leverage, UI/UX, and wallets. This approach allows users and developers, regardless of coding expertise, to easily create decentralized financial products. The forthcoming open-source ecosystem also encourages professional developers to contribute, broadening the range of high-quality modules available. The edgeX module store aims to offer a diverse array of financial module services, enhancing the experiences of both users and developers.

The modular financial system not only simplifies development and usage but also provides substantial security and performance benefits. The independence of functional modules ensures the separation of execution and data layers, with each module undergoing rigorous audits before deployment. edgeX’s official trading product will showcase the modular system’s capabilities, with the upcoming Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version highlighting edgeX’s standard of excellence.



**Summary**

edgeX signifies a transformative shift in the DeFi landscape through its high-performance modular design, fostering a scalable and user-friendly financial system. By offering a comprehensive range of plug-and-play modules, users can effortlessly customize and build financial products with minimal coding experience. edgeX’s open ecosystem and extensive module store are poised to elevate decentralized financial product development and usage, ushering in a more innovative and efficient financial future.
