# Trading Fees

The trading fees on edgeX are determined by the rolling traded volume over the past 30 days, with updates occurring daily at 00:00 (UTC).



* **Maker Orders**: These orders add depth and liquidity to the order book as they are not executed and filled immediately.
* **Taker Orders**: In contrast, these orders are executed and filled immediately, removing liquidity from the order book.



* edgeX adopts a tiered fee structure based on a traderâ€™s rolling 30-day trading volume.&#x20;



* The volume from sub-accounts is aggregated with the main account, ensuring that all sub-accounts benefit from the same fee tier.&#x20;



* Regarding gas fees for trade settlements, edgeX V1 will cover the gas costs on behalf of users.&#x20;
