# Maru 🦭

**Manifesto**

Maru, the 99% everyday trader.\
The ones trading between subway stops, coffee lines, and sleepless nights.

Wall Street had its century.\
Marble lobbies. Bloomberg terminal. Suits and ties.\
They wrote the rules. Told the story.

Most traders were never invited.\
The 99% stayed invisible.

Until now.

Blockchain changed the map.\
Mobile-first. Instant execution. Deep liquidity.\
Leverage in your pocket.

No desks. No offices. No gatekeepers.

Maru doesn’t sit behind a terminal.\
Maru isn’t a whale or a suit.\
Maru trades in motion.\
in coffee shops, on lunch breaks, on the walk home.

Trading-as-a-Habit, always on, always moving.\
Trading-as-Culture, an identity, a badge.\
Trading-as-Esport, tournaments, city by city.

MARU is for anyone who is underestimated,\
undercapitalized, overlooked,\
and traded anyway.

This time, the 99% write the story.\
From 2025 on, MARU is the flag.
