# XP (Pre TGE Season)

As edgeX transitions from a Perp DEX to the EDGE Chain, the EDGE Chain is progressing from closed beta toward open beta. A broader liquidity network is taking shape, supported by both infrastructure maturity and continued expansion at the application layer.



The Pre TGE Season is designed to reward organic platform usage through XP, the campaign’s incentive unit. XP will be distributed on a weekly basis until the TGE, which is expected to occur on or before March 31.
